# Scripts and data sets reproducing the results presented in Gain & Fran√ßois (2020) 

- **imputation_study.R**: R scripts running simulations of two-population split and admixture models and evaluating imputation results  with various proportions of missing values.

- **lfmm2_vs_lfmm_study.R**: R scripts running simulations of LFMM generative models and evaluating power and false discovery rates of lfmm() and lfmm2().

- **fst_outlier_study.R**: R scripts performing genomes scans for selection with PCA, snmf() and and lfmm2() on Scandinavian lines of Arabidopsis thaliana (Atwell et al 2010).

- **athaliana_offset_computation.R**: R scripts performing predictions on genetic offsets under RCPs 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5 for Scandinavian accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana (1001 Genomes, 2016).
